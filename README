NAME
    Featured - Use featured keywords on older Perls

VERSION
    version 0.000002

SYNOPSIS
        require 5.006;

        use Featured 'say';
        say 'hi';

DESCRIPTION
    Enables the use of features from newer Perl's, without actually needing
    that version of Perl.

    Tries to enable the features through feature first, if it's available.

FEATURES
    "say"
        A minimal re-implementation of say from Perl v5.10 for older
        versions of Perl.

        On Perl versions that natively support "say", it enables the native
        version instead.

    "say_io" *expiremental*
        This exists since this implementation of "say" doesn't support
        writing to handles other than the currently selected one.

            use Featured 'say_io';
            open my $fh, '>', 'example.txt';
            say_io $fh, 'hello';
